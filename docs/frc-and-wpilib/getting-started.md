with WPILib for FRC

WPILib is the standard robotics software library provided for teams to write code for their FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC®) robots. 

Once you understand the basics of programming, specifically [C++](/docs/learn-to-code/cplusplus), you'll want to prepare your local computer environment to be able to control the robot and contribute code to our GitHub repository to improve our robot's performance.
