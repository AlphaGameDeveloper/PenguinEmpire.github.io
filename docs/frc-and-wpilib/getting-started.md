... with WPILib for FRC

WPILib is the standard robotics software library provided for teams to write code for their FIRST® Robotics Competition (FRC®) robots. 

:::tip
The subsections under this *FRC and WPILib* section link to a subset of the overall WPILib documentation. The links here focus on the sections that we use regularly. There are also additional links to other related resources for many topics. 
:::

Once you understand the basics of programming, specifically [C++](/docs/learn-to-code/cplusplus), you'll want to prepare your local computer environment to be able to control the robot and contribute code to our [GitHub](/docs/learn-to-code/github) repository to improve our robot's performance.

:::info Prerequisites
If you haven't selected an IDE or set up Git yet on your local environment (laptop), review the [**Getting Started** section of ***Learn to Code***](/docs/learn-to-code/getting-started)
:::

:::note
We usually have a dedicated Windows computer for each driver station all set up to control the robot. This Windows computer should already have NI LabVIEW installed and running. If you need to prepare a new Windows computer to serve as the driver station computer, you'll need to follow the instructions under [Zero to Robot - Step 2: Installing Software](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/index.html#) labelled ["Installing LabVIEW for FRC (LabVIEW only)"](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/labview-setup.html)
:::

:::note Procedure
To get the basics up and running quickly, follow this suggested procedure on your local development environment (laptop):

1. Use Github Desktop to clone the most recent robot code to your local machine. For example, [PenguinEmpire/FRC2023](https://github.com/PenguinEmpire/FRC2023)

1. Review the section named, [Command-Based Programming](/docs/frc-and-wpilib/advanced-programming/command-based-programming).
