Design Pattern

We have adopted the *Command-Based Programming* design pattern for our C++ code to control the robot. This allows multiple different people to work on different commands to perform specific functions on the robot. Those commands can be called as necessary from the primary loops for [auto](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/frc-glossary.html#term-auto) and [teleop](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/frc-glossary.html#term-teleop).


Review the section named, [Command-Based Programming](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html) from the *Advanced Programming* section of *WPILib*.
