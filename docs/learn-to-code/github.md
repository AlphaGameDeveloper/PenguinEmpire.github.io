Hosting service for software development and version control using Git.

In order to contribute your code to [our team's online GitHub repositories](https://github.com/PenguinEmpire/) of code, you'll want to learn how to use [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git). There are several different ways to use it. 

If you prefer working with a graphical user interface ([GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)) rather than a command line interface ([CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)), you can download [Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-desktop) and use it to do most everything you'll need to do with GitHub.

To contribute your code, read through [GitHub's docs on Managing Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches). Follow the instructions to create a new branch. You can just name it with your name and a number. Then make your changes on that branch and then submit a pull request.
