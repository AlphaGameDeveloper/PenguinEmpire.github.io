Python is popular for vision processing and machine learning.  It is a general-purpose language with a simple and elegant syntax, prioritizing readability.

We use Python for programming devices like the [NVIDIA Jetson](/docs/advanced-topics/nvidia-jetson).

Some teams are starting to use the [RobotPy](/docs/learn-to-code/python#robotpy-for-frc) ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/robotpy/)) Python library to program the Robo Rio but this isn't yet supported as of 2024.
