<!-- # Tutorial Intro -->

<!-- Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**. -->

As you use this website to help you learn, you can also help edit it. 

This website uses an open-source project named [Docusaurus](/docs/learn-to-code/docusaurus) for building, deploying, and maintaining this website. Most of the pages here are built with a very simple language named [markdown](/docs/learn-to-code/markdown). If you click "Edit this page" at the bottom of any page, that will take you to the github location for the specific file that generates that page.

You can find all the code we're using at:
[https://github.com/PenguinEmpire/PenguinEmpire.github.io/](https://github.com/PenguinEmpire/PenguinEmpire.github.io/)

If you'd like to contribute changes or edits, please [create a GitHub pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

<!-- Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
