Learning to code

We primarily use [C++](/docs/learn-to-code/cplusplus) for programming the RoboRio for the robot, so you may want to learn the basics of that language first.

At some point early in your journey of learning to code, it will be helpful to have an Integrated Development Environment ([IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)) on a computer that you can access. Several different IDEs will work fine for editing code. Most of us are using [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Sometimes referred to as "VS Code").

If you don't have easy access to a laptop, you can use a chromebook or one of the school's computers and access an online IDE with a free account from [Replit](https://replit.com/)

In order to contribute your code to [our team's online GitHub repositories](https://github.com/PenguinEmpire/) of code, you'll want to learn how to use [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git). There are several different ways to use it. If you prefer working with a graphical user interface ([GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)) rather than a command line interface ([CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)), you can download [Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-desktop) and use it to do most everything you'll need to do with GitHub.

As you use this website to help you learn, you can also help edit it. This website uses an open-source project named [Docusaurus](/docs/learn-to-code/docusaurus) for building, deploying, and maintaining this website. Most of the pages here are built with a very simple language named [markdown](/docs/learn-to-code/markdown). If you click "Edit this page" at the bottom of any page, that will take you to the github location for the specific file that generates that page.

You may also want to learn other programming languages besides C++. There are several possibilities. Another one that we use for some advanced programming is [Python](/docs/learn-to-code/python).
